AddScoped:Creates different instance of resource for each controller ,where resource added will be injected
AddTranscient: Creates one instance of respouce for each new request
AddSingleton:Creates one instance for all requests  : kind of static behaviour.

Web API: It can be consumed from webapplication,Mobile Phones,IOT's
How can i use below action method of webapi for request from only specific domain?
1.create and add new policy for cors for client of specfic domain in configureservices
servicess.AddCors(options=>{option.AddPolicy("MyPolicyName",bulder=>
{builder.withOrigins("https://abc.com");});});
2.Enablecors in configure for that policy
app.UseCors("MyPolicyName");
3.use enablecors attribute with policy name over the action method
[EnableCors("MyPolicyName")]
[HttpGet]
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Movie>>> GetMovie()
{..}

Atrribute routing:
There are many endpoints for get http action, so for less confusion,actions can be decorated with attribute route.
[Route("date/{pubdate:datetime}")]
public IQueryable<BookDto> GetBooks(DateTime pubdate)
{..}
uri: /api/books/date/Thu, 01 May 2008   or
uri: /api/books/date/2008-05-01T00:00:00 

instead of uri :api/books/Thu, 01 May 2008
with default template: "api/books/{pubdate:date}" 


CD/CI
1.Repository-Bitbucket 2.SCM-Git 3.Jenkins 4.WebHooks(call back jenkins pipeline once stages for 1 branch completed)
Process:Trigger on push to bitbucket: When changes are commited and pushed using git into bitbucket repository,Build will be triggered
Multi-branch pipeline:(automatic deployment to multiple branches Feature-->Dev-->Test(if success))
							       	      |		|
									      |_____________Prod

Jenkinsfile ,this file can be generated at codebase,Right click->Add new File->JenkinFile
In Jenkinsfile ,developer can write what stages to perform in CI/CD e.g. stage1 compile,stage2 Build, stage3 commit.
Jenkins file written in groovy language.

Github Vs BitBucket
If you boil it down to the most basic and fundamental difference between GitHub and Bitbucket, it is this: GitHub is focused around public code, and Bitbucket is for private. Basically, GitHub has a huge open-source community, and Bitbucket tends to have mostly enterprise and business users.
Git vs Bitbucket
Git is the repository.and Bitbucket/GitHub is webbased application to work with versioniong of code resided in Git.



Identity terms:
USer: someone present in our database
Role: what rights user have,based on who the user is,user is added to role, In my application,regietered users get added to Advisor role. [Authorize(Role="Advisor,Admin")]
Claims: User should have a claim to access some of the resources, (e.g. Employees can access getMaternityLeave only if they have 'Female' claim). Claim base authorization-create policy named female,add in authorization middleware,add as attribute over actionmethod.
principal/identity: gives who the user is loggedin,what roles he have.  e.g.USer.Identity.Name,User.Identity.IsAdministrator..identity is pricipal

Password stored in database as type ntext (national text).can be navarchar(max).Password once hashed by .net identity,are not hashed back.PasswordHasher class of Identity provides two methods,HashPassword: used at registration or regeneration of password.VerifyHashedPassword:During login it first hash the userinput password and then matches with hashed password from database.



In database:
1.add new user
2.add user to existing role
3.add new claim
4.add the user to claim



compile project with release mode in vscode:
Below command compiles code and creates release folder in bin.
dotnet msbuild -property:Configuration=Release

publish command. What it does?What is build? what is .pubxml
When we publish, .cs files generate prjname.dll,views create prj-views.dll and others create content(static files ,referrerd dll's) all this in one package.
once we click on publish,it compiles and generates a package,and place it at specified path/location.Path can be dev/test/prod ftp location from where server picks up package.
Command to publish: dotnet publish -c Release -o /home/mrmlabs/Sam_Workspace/PublishedMoviemgmt
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles?view=aspnetcore-3.1#set-the-environment

What error occurs during build or doing publish?
1.Compile errors 2.dll dependancy errors-dll reference missing 3.permission issues to add/replace files at specified location.

what issues you have faced during migration 3.5 to 4,and how you resolved it:Application was divided in modules,i was working on one module.
steps:1.Change compile settings,and 
2.Solve compile errors and then run.
3.Run and test application,for any runtime errors.
4.If we are using any internal or external dll which are running on 3.5 ,and we are migrating our app to 4,we need to refer dll that are supported for 4


How to create .net Identity Service,  How to consume Identity service?
understanding: once user click on login link,request goes to identity service ,where credentials are decoded and login action executed,which returns JWTBarerAuthenticationToken in response.
JWTAuthenticationtoken stays for that session at browser and browser now can access other authoeized pages in webapp.
Q:when to expire JWTBarerToken: when clicks on signout,when inactive,session expires.
